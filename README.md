About me ðŸ’¬

âš¡ I am a creative individual based in County Clare with Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Music Technology (Sound Engineering). As I worked more with technology I became interested in coding and programming and so took on a Postgraduate Higher Diploma in Software Development. I found throughout this course that I enjoyed working with SQL and Database Management quite a bit, and I am very proud of my Dental Practice project that can be found here [https://github.com/MartinBensonStudent/SQLProject]

ðŸ“« I am currently awaiting graduating where I am poised to graduate with a first class honor's equivalent.

 Here are some other projects I worked on during my course:
